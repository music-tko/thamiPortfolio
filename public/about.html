                    <p class="about-me-long md:text-lg">My name is Thando Khoase but you can call me Thay, my first name meaning love. See the thing is development was never my first love, nor my passion.
                        <br> Wait, don't go just yet. It was neither of those things but I grew to love it so much that it didn't matter that it wasn't my first option. <br>
                    <br>From a young age I had loved fiddling with gadgets, from the family tv to fixing my grand mother's phone 
                    <br>(although I just needed to put it on General instead of Silent, but no one needs to know that.) But that was just it, I fiddled with computers. I didn't think of it long term. <br> 
                    <br>
                    I figured that I would end up in the entertainment industry, I have a passion for singing and acting but it was daunting to think I would have to study about something that I felt came naturally to me and something I loved with it's quirks and flaws. I was stuck. <br>

                    <br>
                    Insert 10th grade, my first taste of computer science with IGCSE. I was one of two girls in those exam centres, but I didn't let it bother me. <br>
                     I was intrigued by the subject, wanting to learn more about, I started going further than the curriculum.
                     
                     <br><br>Learning about logic gates and hexadecimals and binary code and woah, this was pulling me in further. <br>
                    As a lot of self-taught developers start, I started doing my research. Started learning how to design sites, using no code platforms, I started my freelancing journey in the 10th grade and I went from there. <br>
                    <br>
                    Fast forward to the beginning of this year, I had more time to research, I started learning Javascript. It felt insanely hard at first, then I broke it down in pieces and it started to slowly make sense. <br>
